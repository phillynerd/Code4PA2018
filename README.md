# Code4PA2018
My portion of our group project for Code4PA. Represents some very early attempts at end-to-end work in R, plus my first attempt at a really rudimentary shiny dash


All these files are related to the 2018 Code4PA codeathon, dealing with the Opioid Crisis across the state.  Data are from https://data.pa.gov/.  I worked with several coworkers as a team to create a proposal for a two-pronged approach to the opioid epidemic. 

1. For citizens, a resource map that allowed users to find many diverse types of resources aimed at both individuals with substance use issues as well as family members and treatment providers.
2. For policy makers, treatment providers, and others dealing with the opioid epidemic at a system-wide level, a county-level dashboard to look at how the county is performing on select metrics that have been shown to predict the risk of overdose deaths across the state. 

The second item is where I focused my time in R.
